Learning list functions, string functions and creating own functions

Q. Your friend sent you a message, however his keyboard is broken and types a # instead of a space. 
   Replace all of the # characters in the given input with spaces and output the result.

Hint: You can use the replace() function of a string to replace one substring with another.

Q. We have a function that outputs "Welcome, user" as it is called. 
We want to make it more personalized, so redesign the given function so that it will take the name of the user as input and output the welcome message with it.

Sample Input
Tommy

Sample Output
Welcome, Tommy
