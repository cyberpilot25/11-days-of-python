Day 22: Learning tuples and its operations.
Q. You are given a list of contacts, where each contact is represented by a tuple, with the name and age of the contact.
    Complete the program to get a string as input, search for the name in the list of contacts and output the age of the contact in the format presented below:

contacts = [
    ('James', 42),
    ('Amy', 24),
    ('John', 31),
    ('Amanda', 63),
    ('Bob', 18)
]

Sample Input
John

Sample Output 
John is 31

If the contact is not found, the program should output "Not Found".

Hint: Use conditional statements or looping for the same.
