Day 25: Learning Lambda functions

Q. Write a code that calculates the corresponding percentage of a price. Somebody wrote a lambda function to accomplish that, however the lambda is wrong.
Fix the code to output the given percentage of the price.

Sample Input
50
10

Sample Output
5.0

Hint: The first input is the price, while the second input is the percentage we need to calculate: 10% of 50 is 5.0.
