Day 23: Learning tuple unpacking and sets

Q1. Tuples can be used to output multiple values from a function. You need to make a function called calc(), that will take the side length of a square as its argument and return the perimeter and area using a tuple.
The perimeter is the sum of all sides, while the area is the square of the side length.

Sample Input
3

Sample Output
Perimeter: 12
Area: 9

Hint: The given code takes a number from user input, passes it to the calc() function, and uses unpacking to get the returned values.

Q2. (Sets)

You are working on a recruitment platform, which should match the available jobs and the candidates based on their skills.
The skills required for the job, and the candidate's skills are stored in sets.

Complete the program to output the matched skill.

Hint: You can use the intersect operator to get the values present in both sets.
