Day 5: Learning Nested if statments

Fake Fan Question Generator:

Q. Wanna find out if someone else is a true superfan of the same show, movie or interest as you? Create a program that asks what someone is interested in and includes nested if statements to ask annoying follow-up questions to see if someone is the real deal!

Make sure you include multiple if/elif statements and nested if statements too!
